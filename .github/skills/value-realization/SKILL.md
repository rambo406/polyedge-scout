**Type**: Analytical Framework

## Persistent Memory — MANDATORY

**Memory file**: `memory.yml` (co-located with this SKILL.md)

This skill maintains structured state across audit iterations in a YAML memory file.

### At the START of every audit:
1. **Read `memory.yml`** to load current state: audit number, 4-dimension scores, competitive intel, gap priorities, product metrics, and latest audit findings.
2. Use the loaded state as your baseline — do NOT re-derive information that is already tracked.
3. Increment `audit.current_number` for the new audit.

### At the END of every audit:
1. **Update `memory.yml`** with ALL new findings:
   - Update `audit.current_number`, `audit.last_date`, and append to `audit.history`
   - Update `value_realization_scores` if any dimension changed
   - Update `competitive_intel` with any new pricing/feature/user data scraped
   - Update `feature_gap_matrix` if competitive landscape shifted
   - Update `gaps.priorities` if gap priorities changed
   - Update `product_status` with latest test counts, shipped features, etc.
   - Replace `latest_audit` with the new audit's summary, verdict, changes, and proposed improvement
2. **Do NOT duplicate this data into `autopilot.memory.md`** — the YML file is the single source of truth for all value realization state.

## Overview

This skill provides a philosophical framework and analytical methods for evaluating whether end users will "know" what value they can achieve through a product. It guides analysis through the lens of value discovery, rather than providing checklists.

**What this skill provides**:
- Framework to evaluate product ideas when certainty is lacking
- Analysis methods for assessing end user value discovery
- Patterns from real product successes and failures
- Analysis methods for product design and positioning

**Core question**: Can end users clearly understand what value they'll achieve through the product - even if that value takes time to achieve?

**Key terminology**:
- **User**: The person using this skill (product creator, PM, designer, entrepreneur, etc.)
- **End user**: The person who will use the product being discussed
- **Value**: What end users achieve through the product (outcomes such as identity, financial gain, capability enhancement, time savings, etc.)
- **Features**: The product's technical capabilities

**Core distinction**:
- Features are not value
- Features are what the product can do, value is what end users achieve
- Analysis must translate features into specific end user outcomes

## Core Insight

End users adopt products when they **know** what value they'll get. This "knowing" is critical:

- If end users know they'll achieve something valuable (even long-term), they'll use it
- If end users don't know what they'll achieve, they won't use it - no matter how good the product is

**What "knowing" means**:
- End users can explain to themselves or others why they're using the product
- End users can describe what they'll achieve (not just what features exist)
- End users understand the outcome, even if it takes time to achieve

**Observed patterns**:
- When end users can articulate clear value → higher adoption rates
- When end users cannot articulate value → adoption challenges, even with innovative features
- Some end users adopt without full clarity, then discover value through use (progressive discovery)

**Value types end users seek** (but aren't limited to):
- Identity and belonging
- Financial gain
- Short-term benefits
- Long-term benefits
- Status and recognition
- Capability enhancement
- Time savings
- Problem resolution

## The Challenge

Most product creators face a hidden problem: **end users often don't know what they actually want, and how they articulate it may be wrong**.

The job isn't just to build what end users ask for - it's to help end users discover what value they're actually seeking.

## How to Engage with This Skill

This skill operates through conversational analysis. When the user presents a product idea:

1. **Identify the end users** - Determine who will use the product
2. **Examine value discovery** - Analyze whether end users will understand what they'll achieve
3. **Evaluate through four dimensions** - Value clarity, timeline, perception, discovery
4. **Consider context** - Each product, market, and end user group differs

**This framework guides thinking. It does not prescribe solutions.**

**Analysis approach:**
- Must complete analysis of all four dimensions, each dimension as independent section
- Analysis process for each dimension:
  1. Provide status assessment using status indicators (🔴🟡🟢) with specific description of current state (not generic)
  2. Explain the analytical reasoning for this dimension (why this dimension matters for this product)
  3. Systematically apply the dimension's analytical methods to the product idea (cannot skip analysis and jump to questions)
  4. When citing real product cases, base on verifiable information and explain relevance to current product
  5. Pose sharp questions that directly challenge product necessity or require comparison with existing solutions
- After completing all four dimensions, provide summary
- Avoid logical gaps, show complete reasoning chain
- Guide users to make decisions based on analysis

## Analysis Framework

When the user discusses a product idea, analyze these four dimensions to evaluate whether end users will discover value:

### 1. Value Clarity

**Examine**:
- Can end users articulate what they'll achieve?
- Is the value proposition clear or vague to end users?
- Do end users understand the outcome, not just the features?

**Why this matters**:
End users won't adopt a product if they can't explain to themselves (or others) why they're using it.

**Real example - Dropbox** (see `references/real-cases.md` for detailed data):
- Clear value to end users: "I can access my files from any device"
- End users immediately understood what they'd achieve
- Not about "cloud storage" (technical) but about "access anywhere" (value)
- Insight: Translate technical features into user-facing value

**Real example - Google Wave** (see `references/real-cases.md` for detailed analysis):
- Vague value to end users: "Unified communication"
- End users couldn't explain what they'd achieve
- Shut down 14 months after launch despite innovative features
- Lesson: Features without clear value = no adoption

**Analysis method**:
Ask: What would an end user say when asked "Why are you using this?" If the answer is unclear or feature-focused ("because it has X"), dig deeper into the actual value proposition.

### 2. Value Timeline

**Examine**:
- Is the value immediate or delayed for end users?
- If delayed, do end users know it's coming?
- What keeps end users engaged during the journey?

**Why this matters**:
Both short-term and long-term value are valid approaches. The choice depends on the product's nature, specific scenarios, and end user context. Neither is inherently superior.

**Short-term value products** (end users see results in minutes/hours):
- Dropbox: Upload → see file on other device (< 5 minutes)
- Zoom: Click link → join meeting (< 30 seconds)
- Stripe: Run test payment → see it work (< 1 minute)
- Key consideration: Immediate value is the complete product

**Long-term value products** (end users see results in weeks/months):
- Duolingo: Language fluency (6-12 months)
- Fitness apps: Body transformation (3-6 months)
- Investment apps: Wealth building (years)
- Key consideration: End users commit to the journey

**Design approaches available**:
- Pure short-term: Deliver immediate value, that's the complete product
- Pure long-term: End users are committed to the journey, no short-term touchpoints needed
- Hybrid: Long-term goal with optional short-term touchpoints (XP, streaks, milestones)
- All three approaches are valid - choose based on product nature and end user context

**Analysis method**:
Identify the primary value timeline. Assess whether the approach matches the product's nature and target end users' expectations. Don't force short-term mechanisms if end users are already committed to long-term goals.

### 3. Value Perception

**Examine**:
- Can end users see/feel what they achieved?
- Is progress tangible or abstract to end users?
- Can end users show others what they've achieved?

**Why this matters**:
Invisible value feels like no value to end users. Progress must be perceivable.

**Note**: "Perceivable" takes different forms across product types:
- Consumer products: Immediate visual feedback in UI (file appears, photo enhanced)
- Enterprise software: Reports, dashboards, metrics, analytics
- Developer tools: Build outputs, test results, performance metrics
- The key is that end users can point to something concrete that shows value was delivered

**Visible outcomes for end users**:
- Dropbox: File appears on other device (tangible)
- Instagram: Beautiful photo with likes (tangible)
- GitHub: Contribution graph (tangible)
- Duolingo: Streak counter (tangible)
- Observation: These products make achievements visible and shareable

**Invisible outcomes** (problematic for end users):
- "Your data is synced" (abstract, can't see it)
- "Security improved" (no visible change)
- "Algorithm optimized" (nothing looks different)
- Observation: Technical improvements are difficult for end users to perceive without visible manifestations

**Analysis method**:
Identify what end users can point to and say "I achieved this". If the value is invisible, explore ways to make it tangible through UI, notifications, or progress indicators.

### 4. Value Discovery

**Examine**:
- Do end users already know they want this?
- Or will end users discover the value after using it?
- How to help end users discover value they don't yet recognize?

**Why this matters**:
Sometimes end users don't know what they want until they experience it. The product must help them discover it quickly.

**Discovery pattern - Instagram** (see `references/real-cases.md` for growth data):
- End users thought they wanted: "Share photos"
- End users discovered they valued: "Become a photographer" (identity)
- Instagram helped discovery through filters, likes, and social validation
- Insight: Instagram's success came from enabling identity transformation, not just photo sharing utility

**Discovery pattern - Notion**:
- End users thought they wanted: "Take notes"
- End users discovered they valued: "Become organized" (identity)
- Notion helped discovery through flexible databases and templates

**Analysis method**:
Determine whether end users already know what they want, or need to discover it. If discovery is needed, identify the fastest path to the "aha" moment through onboarding, tutorials, or progressive feature revelation.

## Patterns from Real Products

These aren't rules to follow - they're patterns to consider when analyzing specific situations.

For detailed case studies with real data, see `references/real-cases.md` (English) or `references/real-cases-zh.md` (中文).

### Pattern: Value Communication

**Products using concrete outcome descriptions**:
- Dropbox: "Access files from any device"
- Instagram: "Become a photographer" (identity transformation)
- Observation: These products use concrete, achievable outcome descriptions

**Products using technical or feature descriptions**:
- Google Wave: "Unified communication" (technical concept)
- Some products: "Cloud storage with 2GB free" (feature list)
- Some products: "Distributed file synchronization" (technical jargon)
- Observation: These descriptions make it harder for end users to understand what they'll achieve

## Real Examples

For complete case studies with metrics and data sources, see `references/real-cases.md`.

### Success: Dropbox
- **Value to end users**: Access files from any device
- **Timeline**: Immediate (< 5 minutes)
- **End user perception**: File visibly appears on other device
- **Why it worked**: Clear, immediate, visible value for end users
- **Data**: 3900% growth in 15 months (see references)

### Success: Duolingo
- **Value to end users**: Learn a language (long-term)
- **Timeline**: 6-12 months for fluency
- **End user perception**: XP, streaks, levels (immediate feedback)
- **Why it works**: Long-term goal with optional short-term touchpoints
- **Data**: 500M+ users, 3x retention improvement (see references)

### Success: WeChat
- **Value to end users**: Efficient problem-solving (not time-wasting)
- **Philosophy**: "Use and go" - respect end user time
- **Why it worked**: Trust through non-addictive design
- **Data**: 1.3B monthly active users (see references)

### Failure: Google Wave
- **Problem**: End users couldn't explain what they'd achieve
- **Lesson**: Features ≠ Value. End users need to know what they'll achieve.
- **Data**: Shut down 14 months after launch (see references)

### Failure: Quibi
- **Problem**: "10-minute videos on mobile" wasn't a value end users recognized
- **Lesson**: End users already had YouTube/TikTok. No clear additional value.
- **Data**: $1.75B funding, shut down in 6 months (see references)

## When This Framework Applies

**Most applicable for**:
- Consumer products (B2C)
- Competitive markets (end users have alternatives)
- Products requiring adoption and retention
- New product categories (end users don't know what to expect)

**Less applicable for**:
- Enterprise software (decision makers ≠ end users, switching costs high)
- Monopoly products (end users have no choice)
- Products where value IS delayed by nature (investing, insurance)

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Assuming End Users Know What They Want

**The trap**: Building exactly what end users ask for
**The reality**: End users often don't know what they actually need
**The approach**: Help end users discover the real value through conversation and exploration

### Pitfall 2: Focusing on Features Instead of Value

**The trap**: "Our product has X, Y, Z features"
**The reality**: End users don't care about features, they care about what they'll achieve
**The approach**: Always translate features into value: "Feature X helps end users achieve Y"

### Pitfall 3: Copying Patterns Without Context

**The trap**: "Duolingo uses streaks, so we should too"
**The reality**: Streaks work for daily habits, not for episodic use
**The approach**: Understand why a pattern works for end users, then adapt to specific context

### Pitfall 4: Invisible Value

**The trap**: "Our algorithm is 10x better"
**The reality**: If end users can't see/feel the improvement, it doesn't matter
**The approach**: Make value tangible and visible to end users

## Research Methodology

### Verify Information Accuracy

When citing real product cases, base on verifiable information and explain relevance to current product.

**Tool Availability**:
- WebFetch and WebSearch available for verifying information
- When research fails, proceed with analysis based on framework and clearly indicate which information needs verification

### Evaluating Case Study Applicability

The cases in `references/real-cases.md` (Dropbox, Instagram, Duolingo, WeChat, Google Wave, Quibi) illustrate patterns, not universal rules.

**Assess applicability**:
- **Product type match**: B2C consumer apps vs B2B developer tools vs enterprise software
- **Market context match**: Competitive markets vs niche markets vs monopoly situations
- **User behavior match**: Daily use vs episodic use vs one-time transactions
- **Value delivery match**: Immediate utility vs long-term transformation vs hybrid approaches

**When cases don't apply**:
If the user's product differs significantly from reference cases (e.g., B2B infrastructure tool vs C2C social app), search for comparable products in the same domain. Analyze those domain-specific examples instead of forcing consumer app patterns onto different contexts.

**Example**:
- User discusses: Developer infrastructure tool (like Temporal, Kubernetes)
- Reference cases: Consumer apps (Dropbox, Instagram)
- Action: Search for similar developer tools, analyze their value propositions, adoption patterns
- Avoid: Applying Instagram's identity transformation pattern to infrastructure software

### Balancing Exploration and Evidence

**Exploratory thinking** (appropriate when):
- Identifying potential value types end users might seek
- Brainstorming ways to make value visible or tangible
- Considering multiple positioning approaches
- Exploring "what if" scenarios for product direction

**Evidence-based analysis** (required when):
- Claiming specific adoption patterns or metrics
- Comparing to real products or market examples
- Stating what "works" or "doesn't work" in practice
- Conducting analysis based on industry precedents

**Process**:
1. Explore possibilities through discussion and brainstorming
2. When specific claims or comparisons arise, verify with research
3. Conduct analysis based on verified patterns, not assumptions
4. Acknowledge when evidence is limited or context differs from known cases

### Research Sources

**Primary sources** (preferred):
- Official product websites and documentation
- Company blog posts or announcements
- Published metrics, user counts, or growth data
- Academic research or industry reports

**Secondary sources** (use with caution):
- Tech news articles or analysis pieces
- User reviews or community discussions
- Third-party market research or estimates

**Avoid**:
- Relying solely on memory or general knowledge
- Assuming patterns from one domain apply universally
- Making claims without verifiable sources
- Treating reference cases as prescriptive templates

## Guiding Principles

### Core Distinctions

**User vs End user**:
- User: The person using this skill (product creator, PM, designer, entrepreneur, etc.)
- End user: The person who will use the product being discussed
- These are distinct roles with different perspectives

**Features vs Value**:
- Features: What the product does (technical capabilities)
- Value: What end users achieve through the product (outcomes, benefits)
- End users adopt products based on value, not features

**Value perception timing**:
- Immediate perception: End users perceive they achieved something during or right after use
- Delayed perception: End users perceive they achieved something after sustained use over time
- These are not mutually exclusive; products can provide both
- Neither is inherently superior; each addresses different end user needs

### Research Approach

**When encountering unfamiliar concepts**:
- Research mentioned products, technologies, or domain-specific terms
- Use WebFetch or WebSearch to gather current information
- Seek official documentation, published metrics, and verified sources

**Balancing exploration and evidence**:
- Exploratory thinking: Appropriate when identifying potential value types or brainstorming approaches
- Evidence-based analysis: Required when claiming specific patterns, comparing to real products, or stating what works in practice

**Evaluating case applicability**:
- Reference cases illustrate patterns, not universal rules
- Assess whether product type, market context, user behavior, and value delivery match
- When cases do not apply, research comparable products in the relevant domain

## How to Use This Skill

This skill works best in conversation. When the user discusses a product idea:

1. **Explore value clarity**: Can end users articulate what they'll achieve?
2. **Examine the timeline**: Is value immediate or delayed for end users? What's appropriate for this product?
3. **Assess perception**: Can end users see/feel their progress?
4. **Discover hidden value**: What value might end users not yet recognize?

**This isn't a checklist** - it's a way of thinking. Each product is different. Each market is different. The goal is to think clearly about whether end users will "know" what value they'll get.

**Research during analysis**: When the user mentions specific products, technologies, or concepts, this skill may research them via WebFetch or WebSearch to provide context-appropriate analysis based on current information rather than assumptions.

## Key Principles

1. **End users must "know" what value they'll achieve** - even if it takes time
2. **Value types are diverse** - identity, money, benefits, status, capability, and more
3. **End users often don't know what they want** - help them discover it
4. **Perception matters to end users** - invisible value feels like no value
5. **Context is everything** - patterns from one product may not apply to others
6. **Test with real end users, don't assume** - validate in specific scenarios
7. **Both short-term and long-term are valid** - neither is superior, choose based on product nature

## Remember

This skill helps think about value, not prescribe solutions. Every product is unique. Every market is different. The goal is to discover whether end users will clearly understand what they'll achieve - because that understanding is what drives adoption.
